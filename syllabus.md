###DESCRIPTION

Interactives and news apps are changing the way we process media, and the expectations for media producers in newsrooms globally. Data journalism departments and newsrooms like Vox, the NYTimes, ProPublica, and 538 build narrative and newsworthy tools around code; and the participatory nature of their media output invokes new languages and web fluencies. This course will introduce web development for newsroom interactives, including an introduction to web scripting languages, version control for collaborative coding, and the authorship of interactive narrative on the web. The goal of the course is to compliment student's existing coursework and interests with some essential coding skills, by course completion, helping them design, build, and deploy a data-driven, or news-inspired interactive. Students will workshop a news interactive of their own design throughout the course, punctuated by smaller exercises and lecture pairings on the topics of HTML5/CSS3, Javascript and contemporary development in data journalism.

###OBJECTIVE + LEARNING OUTCOMES
Being successful in programming or journalism involves producing under deadline. Employers, editors and co-workers will require that you work efficiently. This course is modeled on your future success, and so deadlines will be applied to keep time with a professional pace. The final project for the course, and primary graded assignment, will depend on an agglutinative series of tasks designed to help you learn and think critically throughout the semester. 

####LEARNING OUTCOMES:

1. how to assess, manipulate, and analyze  data
2. how to bulletproof your data
3. the merits of certain visualization types
4. the mechanics of collaboration and github
5. the basics of building interactive graphics: html/css/js
6. the value of publishing and self-publishing 

####GRADE CALCULATION:
Here is a basic breakdown of graded tasks along that trajectory:

* 20% Attendance/Participation
* 20% Assignments
* 20% Project Proposal
* 40% Final Project, completed on conclusion of the course, submitted after Thanksgiving

TOTAL: 100%

It is understood that coding is tough and you may be new to this, you will be graded on your progress throughout the class, your ability to complete assignments on time, your interaction with peer reviewers, and your ability to justify your decisions thoughtfully; work hard and you'll do well.

###MATERIALS
Coding is an art; you will have a series of art supplies for this course that will all be free unless otherwise noted, but will require some non-trivial investment on your part to set-up. I'm available to help if you need it.

**SET-UP ACCOUNT**

* Hosting Service - [Github](https://github.com/) Account, [signup here](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) 

**DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL**

* A Markdown Editor - [Mou](http://25.io/mou/)


###COURSE POLICIES

**PARTNER POLICY**
You will find a parter, or a triplet in this course and have some time afforded to workshop your ideas, your narratives and your code with them during peer review. They will give me feedback that contributes to your grade; so pair well with your peers.

**ATTENDANCE/PARTICIPATION**
Attendance accounts for 20% of your final grade. 

**ASSIGNMENTS**
Each week you will have readings assigned, accompanied by often (but not always) an `Assignment` and a `Practice` activity. See the calendar below to confirm the expectations from week to week. I will grade your assignments and aggregate them to a 20% contribution to your final grade. Most assignments are working toward your Final Project, counting as 40% of your final grade.

* All assignments will be submitted via [gist](gist.github.com) on your [Github](https://github.com/) account.
* Assignments are due on the following course date unless otherwise indicated. So, if readings and assignments are listed under 9/2, they are due by the following class date, 9/9, unless otherwise indicated

**READINGS**
Readings are assigned to correspond with that week's assignment and class lesson. I'll be lecturing outside the readings with some references to them, and your assignments will allude to them too. Feel free to read ahead to make certain weeks easier. 

**There is no textbook for this course** as most of the resources can be found for free online.

You can find the [FULL BIBLIOGRAPHY](https://github.com/auremoser/web-coding/blob/master/bibliography.md) in the repository for this course.

**LEARNING CENTER**
The University Learning Center has [cool workshops](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3ZdoyWl7j9rN1ZsWFEwbUc2LVE/view) that might be of use to you. There's one on November 5th, for Oral Presentations that you might consider attending to prep your project presentation at the end of the semester (November 24th for us).

#CLASS CALENDAR
This course is 12-weeks long. Dates are based on the [academic calendar](http://www.newschool.edu/registrar/academic-calendar/) for Eugene Lang.

####INTRO TO INTERACTIVES
>"There were three strong consensus answers: first, get good at understanding and presenting data. Second, understand how social media can work as a newsroom tool. Third, get whatever newsroom experience you can working in teams, and in launching new things." ~ Clay Shirky

How can you be a journalist with integrity and intelligence in our contemporary world? You compete with social media, Medium, online platforms for editorializing quotidian experience. Your role is to provide information, unbiased but intelligible, this is the value you bring to your profession, and technologies gives you the media to communicate those values with clarity and immersive quality. This involves some code, but also concise research that guides readers to a greater understanding of the topics you are treating. We'll talk about instances of success and failure in news apps, review some basics of this course and take care of some technical logistics to prep for next week.

* WSJ Graphics, [_Infectionious Diseases and Vaccines_](http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/).

####READINGS:
* Shirky, C., [_Last call: the end of the printed newspaper_](https://medium.com/@cshirky/last-call-c682f6471c70).
* Darnton, R., [_Writing and telling stories_](http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3403047/darnton_news.pdf?sequence=2).
* Rosen, J., [_When to quit your journalism job_](http://pressthink.org/2014/12/when-to-quit-your-journalism-job/).

* Journalism Tools, [_How they did it_](https://medium.com/@Journalism2ls/how-they-did-it-1b2a9baf666a).

####PRACTICE:
* Setup your [Github](github.com/) accounts
* [The Basics of Markdown Syntax, Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
* [CLI Handbook](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)

We will go over this process, but you should practice some of the terminal commands and markdown syntax so that you feel comfortable on your own machines. We'll go over it next week.

####ASSIGNMENT
Find an interactive that you appreciate, prefereably (but not obligatorily) a journalism piece. Write 2 paragraphs about why you chose it, what it is about, how the interactive/online medium chosen was particularly conducive to the narrative (or wasn't). Finally, explain how it was built, do some research to define what programming language it was written in; what was its creation story (if you can find it)?

It could be something like an [NPR multimedia piece](http://apps.npr.org/lookatthis/posts/publichousing/), as complex as a [ProPublica graphic](http://projects.propublica.org/louisiana/), as iconic as [Snowfall](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek), as riveting as a [graphic novel](http://zombies.epicmagazine.com/story/5937), or as arty as [this exhibit of themed photos](http://www.themorningnews.org/gallery/people-of-the-sun), but the effort to understand and document it should be the same. Extra points for finding something not on the list above, or review something in the [13pt Graphics list](http://13pt.com/graphics/), a grouping assembled by the NYTimes.

* [Visual Guide to Git Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/).

####ASSIGNMENT
Think about who handled it (that is, the topic) better:

* Motherboard: <https://www.muckrock.com/drone-census/>
* Muckrock: <https://www.muckrock.com/drone-census/>
* Pitch Interactive: <ttp://drones.pitchinteractive.com/>
* A Quiet Disposition: <http://aquietdisposition.com/>

Why? How? What aspects are more or less compelling, what would you say is a better approach to communicating this material?

Consider the pieces and work shown by the guest lecturer, highlight some aspect of their work that seemed very difficult to you and find some resources online detailing how you would develop skills to support what you find difficult. Maybe they have to code, maybe they have to test, maybe they have to make high quality mockups in Illustrator. Pick something they describe that you don't understand and find ways to learn about it so you might be better prepared to deal with that in the workplace.

####DATA-DRIVEN JOURNALISM
####NO CLASS: Yom Kippur

There will  be no class on this date, but I would like you to investigate datasets and topics for your final project during this break week, and do the readings and exercise below. The makeup course will be the final project presentation day, a chance to workshop your projects as well, held on 11/24/15.

>"Narrative can on the one hand be broken down into a set of universal laws and principles that may transcend mediums. Stories have temporality in common (they deal with time) as well as causation (they deal with cause and effect of something). On the other hand there are the more media specific narrative affordances as for example in the way that film, opera, novel and data visualisation – because of their physicality and the dimensions open to them – would be able to give a different ‘staging’ of a story." ~ C. Twigg

Including [The Gaza Platform](https://gazaplatform.amnesty.org/), a partnership with Amnesty Intl.

####ASSIGNMENT
Do some research, find a few stories that inspire you, or [some that don't](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/gallery/2013/aug/01/16-useless-infographics?CMP=twt_gu). Think about what data they use to prove their assertions, or what datasets might help to bolster their arguments. 

Consider if you could develop a visualization to support that topic, or study it further. Consider what open data sources you could use (see those listed in the readings above); consider what closed data sources you might try to solicit (check out this [Five Minute Field Guide](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/getting_data_0.html) to find data relevant to your idea).

Try to find one or two datasets that suit a narrative or argument you'd like to build. Write 1-3 paragraphs about:
 
* what datasets you chose
* why you chose them
* what story you might like to tell
* what type of data you have (time-series, geospatial, graph data)?
* how you expect your audience to engage with those data. 

Link to the datasets if they are available online, if not, explain how you intend to get those data over the course of the next few weeks.

Try to do that and integrate your practice into the assignment below (add it to you bl.ocks account if you can!).

Here is [an example using C3.JS for a categorical bar chart](http://bl.ocks.org/auremoser/6236a61e5383ab0bc71d). If you feel like this is more relevant to your dataset, you can use that template too.

####ASSIGNMENT
1. Find some time-series or statistical data. 
2. Think about the narrative that you might build around it. 
3. Write a pitch (< 3 ¶s) explaining your story and linking to the data. 
4. Defend your pitch in a few short arguments, describing the format of your data, and what tools/languages you would use to explore and visualize it.
5. Use your practice exercise to defend your pitch with a prototype.

####COLOR THEORY: ART, DESIGN, + PERCEPTION
>"It’s not uncommon for designers to confuse a beautiful looking product with one that works beautifully. A great technique for creating smarter, better products is to approach them using story-centered design." ~ B. Kowitz

####ASSIGNMENT
Make a few sketches of the data visualizations that might suit your project, take a photo of those sketches and create a style guide or swatch board (with color palette, fonts, layout indications) in a gist. These can build on your prototype time-series, mapping, or graph visualizations from previous weeks, but should reflect your "ideal" layout and not be limited to what you were able to accomplish in previous weeks.

It doesn't have to be as detailed as [this one](http://design.sunlightlabs.com/projects/Sunlight-StyleGuide-DataViz.pdf) but it should have a few main sections:

* Colors (hex values chosen)
* Fonts
* Template (general layout, with sketches-hand sketched and photographed/embedded in a gist or uploaded somewhere.
* Description of the dataset(s)
* Description of the concept and larger narrative - what aspects of your data will this style highlight?

* Salkever, A., [_How to Choose the Right Visualization_](http://blog.import.io/post/how-to-choose-the-right-visualization-for-your-data).

####ASSIGNMENT - PROPOSAL
Consider the data visualization types in [this catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/), and the [tools listed here](http://selection.datavisualization.ch/). 

Determine which type of visualizations you might make with your data, list them, and then select one to test and pursue. 

Diagram (aka, discuss in one ¶) what type of visualization you choose for your dataset and what tools you will use to achieve this (include the languages they are written in or the languages you might need to code in). 

Keep in mind how this changes or updates your style guide from last week; update that assignment where necessary; and link to the style guide at the end of your proposal.

####CREATIVE NARRATIVE

>"And I want you to ask yourself when you make things, when you prototype interactions, 'am I thinking about my own clock, or the user’s?' Am I going to help someone make order in his or her life, or am I going to send that person to a commune in Vermont?" ~ P. Ford

![Warming](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auremoser/web-coding/master/_imgs/warm.gif)

**Interactive to Inspire**: 

* Bloomberg, [_"What's really warming the world?_](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/).

####PRACTICE
Think about where you would like to publish your project and in what format. Will it be a stand-alone site with some text, a text-dense narrative with embedded graphs, a larger scroll-pages multimedia piece with images and video embeds to compliment? 

####ASSIGNMENT
Think about the interactives we've seen this semester and plan out your template layout.

Reconsider your data and the pitch exercises from previous weeks, choose the best visualization and pitch for your narrative and pursue pushing that onto the web.

Here are some resources to help you get it on the web.

* [Github pages templates for sites](https://pages.github.com/)
* [Creating project pages on Github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/)

Here is [an example of an interactive time series visualization](http://auremoser.github.io/graphitiTime/) of Graffiti cleanup rates (taken from 311 data). Here is [the code and readme](https://github.com/auremoser/graphitiTime/) explaining how this was made. This will be the format of your final projects (unless you choose a more creative way of hosting it). All of your code will be submitted on github with at least a link to the live demo in the `README.md` of your repository.

####UNDERSTANDING IMPACT + ADDRESSING BIAS

>"I realize there’s a whole lot of inspiration out there, and some damn fine examples of great work, but I still find it hard to get a sense of direction...We need to know what makes a data story “work”. And what does a data story that “works” even mean?" ~ N. Diakopoulos

####PRESENTATIONS AND PROJECT CLINIC

>"Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it’s poison to the audience." ~ Pixar, [_22 Rules of storytelling_](http://www.aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/07/pixars-22-rules-of-storytelling/).

Tues., 11/24, 6-7:50PM, Make-up for Yom Kippur Course

This will be a follow-up lab to polish your projects and get extra-help. I realize it's before Thanksgiving and this might be a tense travel time for you. Sorry about that, the New School mandates that the make-up is on this day.

####FINAL PROJECTS
**DUE**: 11/25/15 9AM, in my inbox. 

Please send the link to your project repository and any supportive materials to my email <mosera@newschool.edu>.

More detailed instructions on this will be sent out closer to the due date.

But in general, this project is a big deal! The final project is a substantial portion of your grade, and there will be no late grading because they lock me out of the grading system 7 days after our last class (around the 26th); ie. no late grades accepted.


#SERVICES + RESOURCES

###CODE (OF CONDUCT)
It's not that hard, code or respect. You will be expected to produce both in this class. We will set the tone for it here, so you can graple with its absence from an informed position in the workplace. 

Part of that code of conduct is a partnership we are building in mutual respect. I take it personally when you miss my classes and my assignments; being ontime is a way to show myself and the other students that you have respect for us. If you fail to do that, you're hindering your own education, but more importantly you're hindering your reputation as a person with integrity. 

Here are a few general things:

* Late assignments will not be accepted 
* Attendance is mandatory barring an emergency which you can work out with the instructor over email. 
* Regardless of circumstances, you're expected to turn in your assignment on the day that it's due, and otherwise keep up with work.

### DISABILITY SERVIES
In keeping with [the university’s policy]
(http://www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/) of providing equal access for students
with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to contact Student Disability Service (SDS). SDS will conduct an intake and, if appropriate, the Director will provide an academic accommodation notification letter for you to bring to me. At that point, I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course. 

###UNIVERSITY POLICIES
There are [a few](
http://www.newschool.edu/leadership/provost/policies/); including the Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy, Intellectual Property Rights Poly and [Plagiarism Policy](http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center/virtual-handout-drawer/).
