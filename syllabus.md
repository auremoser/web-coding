###DESCRIPTION

Interactives and news apps are changing the way we process media, and the expectations for media producers in newsrooms globally. Data journalism departments and newsrooms like Vox, the NYTimes, ProPublica, and 538 build narrative and newsworthy tools around code; and the participatory nature of their media output invokes new languages and web fluencies. This course will introduce web development for newsroom interactives, including an introduction to web scripting languages, version control for collaborative coding, and the authorship of interactive narrative on the web. The goal of the course is to compliment student's existing coursework and interests with some essential coding skills, by course completion, helping them design, build, and deploy a data-driven, or news-inspired interactive. Students will workshop a news interactive of their own design throughout the course, punctuated by smaller exercises and lecture pairings on the topics of HTML5/CSS3, Javascript and contemporary development in data journalism.

###OBJECTIVE + LEARNING OUTCOMES
Being successful in programming or journalism involves producing under deadline. Employers, editors and co-workers will require that you work efficiently. This course is modeled on your future success, and so deadlines will be applied to keep time with a professional pace. The final project for the course, and primary graded assignment, will depend on an agglutinative series of tasks designed to help you learn and think critically throughout the semester. 

Here's some basic things I hope to teach:

* how to assess, manipulate, and analyze  data
* how to bulletproof your data
* the merits of certain visualization types
* the mechanics of collaboration and github
* the basics of building interactive graphics: html/css/js
* the value of publishing and self-publishing 

###MATERIALS
Coding is an art; you will have a series of supplies for this course that will all be free unless otherwise noted, but will require some non-trivial investment on your part to setup. I'm available to help if you need it.

* Hosting Service - [Github](https://github.com/) Account, [signup here](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) 
* Text Editor - [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* A Markdown Editor - [Mou](http://25.io/mou/)

###ASSIGNMENTS
All assignments will be submitted via gist on your github account. Most will be a written response to a coding exercise, or some coding. They are due on the following course date unless otherwise indicated.

Here is a basic breakdown of graded tasks along that trajectory:

* 20% Attendance/Participation
* 20% Assignments
* 20% Project Proposal
* 40% Final Project, completed on conclusion of the course, submitted after Thanksgiving

It is understood that coding is tough and you may be new to this, you will be graded on your progress throughout the class, your ability to complete assignments on time, your interaction with peer reviewers, and your ability to justify your decisions thoughtfully; work hard and you'll do well.

**Partner Policy**

You will find a parter, or a triplet in this course and have some time afforded to workshop your ideas, your narratives and your code with them during peer review. They will give me feedback that contributes to your grade; so pair well with your peers.

**Readings**

Readings are assigned to correspond with that week's assignment and class lesson. I'll be lecturing outside the readings with some references to them, and your assignments will allude to them too. Feel free to read ahead to make certain weeks easier. **There is no textbook for this course** as most of the resources can be found for free online.


##CALENDAR
This course is 12-weeks long. Dates are based on the [academic calendar](http://www.newschool.edu/registrar/academic-calendar/) for Eugene Lang.

###9/2/15
####INTRO TO INTERACTIVES
>"There were three strong consensus answers: first, get good at understanding and presenting data. Second, understand how social media can work as a newsroom tool. Third, get whatever newsroom experience you can working in teams, and in launching new things." ~ Clay Shirky

![Measles]()

**Interactive to Inspire**: WSJ Graphics, [_Infectionious Diseases and Vaccines_](http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/).

How can you be a journalist with integrity in our contemporary world? You compete with social media, Medium, online platforms for editorializing quotidian experience. Your role is to provide information, unbiased but intelligible, this is the value you bring to your profession, and technologies gives you the media to communicate those values with clarity and immersive quality. This involves some code, but also concise research that guides readers to a greater understanding of the topics you are treating. We'll talk about instances of success and failure in news apps, review some basics of this course and take care of some technical logistics to prep for next week.

####READINGS:
* Shirky, C., [_Last call: the end of the printed newspaper_](https://medium.com/@cshirky/last-call-c682f6471c70).
* Darnton, R., [_Writing and telling stories_](http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3403047/darnton_news.pdf?sequence=2).
* Rosen, J., [_When to quit your journalism job_](http://pressthink.org/2014/12/when-to-quit-your-journalism-job/).
* [_The hypocrisy of the Internet journalist_](https://medium.com/message/the-hypocrisy-of-the-internet-journalist-587d33f6279e).

####PRACTICE:
* Setup your Github accounts
* [The Basics of Markdown Syntax, Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)

####ASSIGNMENT
Find an interactive that you appreciate, prefereably (but not obligatorily) a journalism piece. Write 2 paragraphs about why you chose it, what it is about, how the interactive/online medium chosen was particularly conducive to the narrative (or wasn't). Finally, explain how it was built, do some research to define what programming language it was written in; what was its creation story (if you can find it)?

It could be something like an [NPR multimedia piece](http://apps.npr.org/lookatthis/posts/publichousing/), as complex as a [ProPublica graphic](http://projects.propublica.org/louisiana/), as iconic as [Snowfall](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek), as riveting as a [graphic novel](http://zombies.epicmagazine.com/story/5937), or as arty as [this exhibit of themed photos](http://www.themorningnews.org/gallery/people-of-the-sun), but the effort to understand and document it should be the same. Extra points for finding something not on the list above.


###9/9/15
MARK-UP/DOWN: SELF-PUBLISHING IN INTERACTIVE NEWS

####READING
* Kiss, J. and Arthur, C., [_Publishers or platforms? Media giants may be forced to choose_](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/29/twitter-urged-responsible-online-abuse)
* Kaufman, L., [_Bombings trip up Reddit in its turn in spotlight_](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/business/media/bombings-trip-up-reddit-in-its-turn-in-spotlight.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)

####ASSIGNMENT
Take a look at the following platforms for online journalism, consider the merits of each and choose one to profile. Explain in a few paragraphs why it appeals to you, what you might use it for, and describe how you tested it to confirm. Propose another method of self-publishing if you find none of these satisfactory, and explain why it seems superior.

* [Reportedly](https://medium.com/reportedly/welcome-to-reported-ly-3363a5fb7ea5)
* [Grasswire](https://gigaom.com/2014/05/16/grasswire-founder-austen-allred-is-trying-to-build-a-wikipedia-style-platform-for-real-time-news/)
* [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/)

Consider the readings an try include a sentence or two about how they are relevant to this exercise.

####PRACTICE
Try to setup up a bl.ocks account based on your gists (the first few assignments for this course should suffice). Bl.ocks accounts like [mine](http://bl.ocks.org/auremoser) are based on gists, so you're already on your way to having an online interactive portfolio, yay!

This syllabus is written in markdown. You can study how it's made by looking at the format and the rendered version. Click on `RAW` (a button) in the Github view to compare, copy the raw text into [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) and view the side-by-side comparison.

NEW PLATFOR[U]MS: HOSTING FOR NEWS INTERACTIVES

**Guest Lecturers** 

##### [Lena Groeger](http://www.propublica.org/site/author/lena_groeger), ProPublica

Lena is a science journalist, developer, and designer at ProPublica, an investigative journalism group with a focus on longitudinal stories and throughful interactives. She'll give a talk on her work, and then you can all head home and work on the readings/assignments for this week.

She's worked on interactive projects like:

* [_Treatment tracker_](https://projects.propublica.org/treatment/)
* [_Worker's comp_](http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/workers-compensation-benefits-by-limb)
* [_The power of loops_](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/on-repeat-how-to-use-loops-to-explain-anything)

#####[Nadja Popovich](http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nadja-popovich), The Guardian US

Nadja is an interactive journalist at the Guardian U.S.

She's worked on interactive projects like:

* [_The counted_](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-map-us-police-killings)
* [_Watch how the measles outbreak spread..._](http://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2015/feb/05/-sp-watch-how-measles-outbreak-spreads-when-kids-get-vaccinated)
* [_Are you reflected in the new Congress?_](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2014/nov/06/-sp-congress-diversity-women-race-lgbt-are-you-represented)

####READINGS
* Koc, E., [_Interactive storytelling at the New York Times_](http://futurenytimes.org/reviews/interactive-storytelling/).
* Few, S., [_Data art vs. data visualization_](http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1245).
* Slobin, S., [_Examples of data journalism_](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/introduction_3.html).

####PRACTICE
Continue to practice your fluency in Github commands with this online interactive tutorial.

* [Code School Interactive Git Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).
* [Visual Guide to Git Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/).


####ASSIGNMENT
Think about who handled it (that is, the topic) better:

* Motherboard: <https://www.muckrock.com/drone-census/>
* Muckrock: <https://www.muckrock.com/drone-census/>
* A Quiet Disposition: <http://aquietdisposition.com/>

Why? How? What aspects are more or less compelling, what would you say is a better approach to communicating this material?

Consider the pieces and work shown by the guest lecturer, highlight some aspect of their work that seemed very difficult to you and find some resources online detailing how you would develop skills to support what you find difficult. Maybe they have to code, maybe they have to test, maybe they have to make high quality mockups in Illustrator. Pick something they describe that you don't understand and find ways to learn about it so you might be better prepared to deal with that in the workplace.

###9/23/15 
####NO CLASS: Yom Kippur

See "Make-up" on 11/24/15

There will otherwise be no class on this date, but I would like you to investigate datasets and topics for your final project during this break week. The makeup course will be an optional extended office hour to workshop your ideas on 11/24.

####ASSIGNMENT
Do some research, find a few stories that inspire you, or [some that don't](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/gallery/2013/aug/01/16-useless-infographics?CMP=twt_gu). Think about what data they use to prove their assertions, or what datasets might help to bolster their arguments. 

Consider if you could develop a visualization to support that topic, or study it further. Consider what open data sources you could use (see those listed in the readings above); consider what closed data sources you might try to solicit (check out this [Five Minute Field Guide](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/getting_data_0.html) to find data relevant to your idea).

Try to find one or two datasets that suit a narrative or argument you'd like to build. Write 1-3 paragraphs about:
 
* what datasets you chose
* why you chose them
* what story you might like to tell
* what type of data you have (time-series, geospatial, graph data)?
* how you expect your audience to engage with those data. 

Link to the datasets if they are available online, if not, explain how you intend to get those data over the course of the next few weeks.

####PRACTICE

[C3.JS](http://c3js.org/) is a reusable chart library based on D3. Take a look at [the code for this Timeseries Chart](http://c3js.org/samples/timeseries.html) and think about how you could modify it to accommodate data of your choice.

Try to do that and integrate your practice into the assignment below (add it to you bl.ocks account if you can!).

Here is [an example using C3.JS for a categorical bar chart](http://bl.ocks.org/auremoser/6236a61e5383ab0bc71d). If you feel like this is more relevant to your dataset, you can use that template too.

####ASSIGNMENT
1. Find some time-series or statistical data. 
2. Think about the narrative that you might build around it. 
3. Write a pitch (a few ¶s) explaining your story and linking to the data. 
4. Defend your pitch in a few short arguments, describing the format of your data, and what tools/languages you would use to explore and visualize it.

####PRACTICE
There are various JS tools for building graph visualizations, [Sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org/) and [Arbor.js](http://arborjs.org/) among them. 
Peruse the examples available using these libraries online, or try [Gephi](http://gephi.github.io/), a free desktop tool for visualization.

Here's [a sample visualization that uses Gexf to visualize graffiti artists](https://github.com/auremoser/graphitiNEt) and their formal art influences, color-coded by country of origin. 

Try to build a prototype with one of these libraries/tools to support your assignment pitch.


####ASSIGNMENT
1. Find some network/graph data or a collection of datasets that you think might compliment eachother, or might reveal something interesting in ensemble. 
2. Write a pitch (a few ¶s) explaining your story and linking to the data. 
3. Defend your pitch in a few short arguments, describing the format of your data, and what tools/languages you would use to explore and visualize it.

####ASSIGNMENT
Consider the data visualization types in [this catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/), and the [tools listed here](http://selection.datavisualization.ch/). 

Determine which type of visualizations you might make with your data, list them, and then select one to test and pursue. 

Diagram (aka, discuss in one ¶) what type of visualization you choose for your dataset and what tools you will use to achieve this (include the languages they are written in or the languages you might need to code in). 

Keep in mind how this changes or updates your style guide from last week; update that assignment where necessary.

####ASSIGNMENT
Think about the interactives we've seen this semester and plan out your template layout.

Reconsider your data and the pitch exercises from previous weeks, choose the best visualization and pitch for your narrative and pursue pushing that onto the web.

Here are some resources to help you get it on the web.
* [Github pages templates for sites](https://pages.github.com/)
* [Creating project pages on Github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/)

###11/24/15
Make-up for Yom Kippur Course

Tues., 11/24, 6-7:50PM

This will be a follow-up lab to polish your projects and get extra-help. I realize it's before Thanksgiving and this might be a tense travel time for you. Sorry about that, the New School mandates that the make-up is on this day.

#####FINAL PROJECTS
**DUE**: 11/25/15 9AM, in my inbox. 

Please send the link to your project repository and any supportive materials to my email <mosera@newschool.edu>.

This is a big deal! The final project is a substantial portion of your grade, and there will be no late grading because they lock me out of the grading system 7 days after our last class (around the 26th); ie. no late grades accepted.

###CODE (OF CONDUCT)
It's not that hard, code or respect. You will be expected to produce both in this class. We will set the tone for it here, so you can graple with its absence from an informed position in the workplace. 

Part of that code of conduct is a partnership we are building in mutual respect. I take it personally when you miss my classes and my assignments; being ontime is a way to show myself and the other students that you have respect for us. If you fail to do that, you're hindering your own education, but more importantly you're hindering your reputation as a person with integrity. Here are a few general things:

* Late assignments will not be accepted 
* Attendance is mandatory barring an emergency which you can work out with the instructor over email. 
* Regardless of circumstances, you're expected to turn in your assignment on the day that it's due, and otherwise keep up with work

#### DISABILITY SERVIES
In keeping with [the university’s policy]
(http://www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/) of providing equal access for students
with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to contact Student Disability Service (SDS). SDS will conduct an intake and, if appropriate, the Director will provide an academic accommodation notification letter for you to bring to me. At that point, I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course. 

####UNIVERSITY POLICIES
There are [a few](
http://www.newschool.edu/leadership/provost/policies/); including the Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy, Intellectual Property Rights Poly and [Plagiarism Policy](http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center/virtual-handout-drawer/).
